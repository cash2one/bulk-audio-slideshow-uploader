## Overview

This project enables the creation and uploading of automatically generated videos from a large collection of rare recordings that are out of copyright. Each item in the collection contains audio, imagery, and text metadata. 

There are a few sub-tasks:
1) Create a video from a set of images and an mp3
2) Batch create videos
3) Upload video in a scalable way, with metadata
3) Batch-upload a set of created videos, or batch-create/upload a set of videos
